- A simulation of Game of Life, a cellular automaton, on an infinite plane, written in **C**.
- It allows to set the **initial state** and then calculate and display **subsequent generations**, generate **state dumps** and adjust the **window position**.
- This project taught me **memory management** in C and memory leaks check and control **valgrind**, as well as use of **pointers** and **structs**.
